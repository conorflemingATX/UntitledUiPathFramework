module ApplicationTypes

(* 
    In here I am going to be attempting to write the main application types for the framework, although I'm still unsure of how they are going to go really. But at least I am at the step where this is unambiguously the problem I have to solve next, instead of putting it off even more.

    The main types are the state model, the message, and the command. All three I think should also have their respective DTO type for use with on the UiPath side.
    
    The good new is that this is probably the most difficult part of the entire process, so if I crack this it should be smooth sailing.
